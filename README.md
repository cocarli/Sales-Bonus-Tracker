# Bonus Calculator – Excel Project  
**Created by Carlos Ortiz**

## Overview
This project is a professional-grade bonus calculator built in Excel. It evaluates employee performance based on sales figures and determines bonus eligibility, rates, and final bonus amounts using conditional logic and formulas.

## Features
- **IF and Nested IF Logic** to assess bonus eligibility
- **Auto-calculated Bonus Amounts** based on sales performance
- **Data Validation Dropdowns** for consistent user inputs
- **Conditional Formatting** to visually flag performance
- **Notes Column** for additional manager context

## Skills Demonstrated
- Excel Formulas: `IF`, `SUM`, `AutoSum`
- Conditional Formatting
- Data Validation (Dropdown Menus)
- Spreadsheet Organization & Design
- Clean UI and data labeling

## Use Case
This spreadsheet could be used in small businesses or team management settings where performance-based incentives are tracked manually. It’s designed to be intuitive, scalable, and adaptable to other criteria (e.g. attendance, tenure, KPIs).

## Future Improvements
- Add dynamic bonus rate tables with VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP
- Integrate with Power BI for visual reporting
- Automate reporting with macros or Python scripting
